# Sabor Cuscatleco

## Overview
Sabor Cuscatleco is a front-end project that represents a fictional Salvadoran restaurant. It was created to demonstrate foundational web development skills using HTML and CSS. The project emphasizes clean structure, semantic markup, and a culturally inspired design that reflects El Salvador’s vibrant culinary identity.

## Purpose
This website was built as a portfolio piece for showcasing beginner-to-intermediate front-end development skills. It’s intended to simulate a small business website that could belong to a local restaurant — complete with a home page, menu highlights, and cultural imagery.

The project was developed as part of a learning process to:

-Strengthen understanding of semantic HTML and CSS organization.

-Practice responsive and accessible layout design.

-Gain experience preparing a project to present at a career fair or in a developer portfolio.

## Features
-Static website built entirely with HTML and CSS.
-Cultural design theme inspired by traditional Salvadoran aesthetics and food.
-Restaurant branding concept with logo, hero section, featured dishes, and footer.
-Call-to-action button (“Reserve Table”) placed for realistic site flow.

## Tech Stack
-HTML5:	Structure and semantic layout.

-CSS3:	Styling, layout design, responsiveness.

-GitHub: Pages	Hosting and deployment.

## Installation
No installation required. The page is deployed via GitHub Pages.

## Future improvements

-Expand to multi-page structure (Menu, About, Contact).
-Incorporate CSS animations and transitions for smoother UX.
-Improve accessibility features (alt text, color contrast, ARIA labels).
